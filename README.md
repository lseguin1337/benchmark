# Compare different target impact on performance and bundle size

The goal of this project is to simply build multiple peaces of code and to transpile them into different target (es5 + promise polyfill and es2017) to compare the performances.

# Build all bundles

To build all tests you can simply run:

```shell
npm run build
```

# Run

```shell
npm run start
```
